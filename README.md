# 🤖 ZENTRON: A Practical AI Assistant for Everyday Chaos

> *“More than just automation—Zentron is how I stay sane in code, college, and everything in between.”*

**Zentron** is a voice-enabled, Python-based desktop assistant designed to help with everyday tasks like opening files, searching the web, setting reminders, and more. It’s modular, easy to expand, and built by **Bushra Firdose (Ain)** as part of a personal project to blend coding practice with real-world utility.

Originally inspired by Iron Man, the name "Zentron" came from the desire to build something unique—practical, personal, and powerful enough to grow with new features over time.

## 🚀 Features

This is a work-in-progress project, but here’s what it currently does:

- 🎙️ **Voice Input & Feedback** – Uses speech recognition to understand commands and text-to-speech to respond.
- 🌐 **Google Search / Wikipedia Access** – Say something like “search Python list methods” and get an instant answer.
- 📂 **File and Folder Actions** – Open apps, browse folders, and run files using voice commands.
- 🕒 **Reminders & Notes** – Set reminders and take voice-based quick notes.
- ⚙️ **Modular Command System** – You can easily add new features or automate repetitive tasks.
- 🧪 **Experiment Playground** – Ideal for learning how to integrate APIs, automate local actions, and work with Python libraries.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

Zentron runs on a lightweight and beginner-friendly stack:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **SpeechRecognition + PyAudio** – for converting your voice into commands
- **pyttsx3** – offline text-to-speech engine for replies
- **PYQT5** (optional, for web GUI features)
- **OS & Subprocess** – for running system-level tasks
- **Wikipedia / Webbrowser / datetime** – for info-based commands
- **OpenAI API (optional)** – for smarter conversations and content generation

Optional Hardware Add-ons:
- **Arduino / Raspberry Pi** – Zentron can control LEDs or sensors if hooked to a board - not yet done but planning to do.
